• What are the major differences between ETL and ELT approaches to data transformation?
	
	ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) are 
	two different approaches to data transformation in the context of data 
	warehousing and business intelligence.
	
	In both cases names are self explanaitory. In ETL we transform the data
	before loading on target, while in ELT we load data on target and then
	transform it.
	

• What are the major differences between data analytics and data engineering?
	
	Data analytics aims on analysis, interpretation and visualization of data. 

	Data engineering aims on maintaining data infrastructure, data modeling, data processing, data cleaning.


• Is there any specific software/tool/technology you are really interested in working with?

	I would be happy to try to work with SnowSQL and MsSQL.
